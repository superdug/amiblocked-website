I've operated an internet presence since 1997 when I registered my first .com domain.  From there I would go from shared hosting, to virtual hosting and shell access, to full blown linux servers, back to shared virtual servers, and then to someone elses server?  I suppose that's where we're at today.  Back in the world of shared hosting, and the world is just simpler there, cheaper there, and dare I say it, more secure there?  

The idea I've had for an internet presence is a place where I can publish my musings onto the entirety of the internet whenever I want to.  I've spent hundreds of dollars a month, to nothing in costs througout the years and I am back to having all of my eggs in one proverbial basket.  I'm on cloudflare for everything except email at this point and that's just because I'm hosting another project that can't quite use a catch-all email address.  

I've done this site in a few different ways in the past, but recently I just decided to use a cloudflare page, mixed in some analytics, tied in some ghetto comments, and ... website!
