 Beginning of check-in meeting:
“Hello. My name is ________, and I’m a recovering porn addict and the chairperson for today’s meeting. This is a closed meeting, only those desiring their own personal porn sobriety please. We ask you mute your microphone when you are not speaking to avoid background noise and please turn off your camera if you are up and about to avoid distractions.”
“This is a check-in meeting in which we get current through our shares. As we go around the room, let us focus on where we are in our recovery and where we are in our current life situation. Please bring your focus to your struggles and triumphs in your life that have affected your recovery either positively or negatively. There is no wrong check-in, please share what you are willing to and when you are done say ``pass.”
“If this is your first meeting, please share what brought you here and what you are wanting to get from this meeting and the program in general. There will be a portion of the meeting after check-ins where we will have open discussion and you will have the ability to ask questions.”
“As the chair, I will begin my check-in first and then call on you individually for you to give your shares.”


Closing of the meeting:
“Meeting attendance contributes much to recovery but is not a substitute for a sponsor, program buddy or working the steps. We therefore urge you to use all the tools the program has to offer. In the chat, someone has posted links to the parent texts for 12-step recovery as well as to a WhatsApp chat group that is available to all members of the fellowship.”
“As part of our seventh tradition that states we should be self supporting, a gofundme has been started to cover the operational costs of PA. For more information on how you can chip in please visit the link provided in the chat."
“Thank you to everyone who shared. We’d like to remind everyone that anything you have heard at this meeting is strictly the opinion of the individual participant. The principles of PA are found in our Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions. This is an anonymous program. Please keep the name, address and phone number of anyone you meet or learn about in PA to yourself and what we say here, let it stay here. Remember, we never identify ourselves publicly with PA in the press, radio, TV or films; neither does anyone speak for PA.”
